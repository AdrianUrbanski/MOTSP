# MOTSP

This is a final project for a university evolutionary algorithms course. NanOS and I attempted to solve Multiobjective Travelling Salesman Problem. The 'raport' notebook contains a concise summary of our progress, challenges we faced and results we achieved on a few benchmarks. In the 'MOTSP' notebook you can find function prototypes and more tests.

# Methods

The algorithms we used are modified versions of:

* [NSGA-II algorithm, proposed by K. Deb, A. Pratap, S. Agrawal and T. Meyarivan](https://sci2s.ugr.es/sites/default/files/files/Teaching/OtherPostGraduateCourses/MasterEstructuras/bibliografia/Deb_NSGAII.pdf)
* [MOEA/D algorithm, whose authors are Q. Zhang and H. Li](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/xlwang/files/20150312_174546.pdf)
